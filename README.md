I've had to nuke this several times and start over, mostly from scratch.  That's why there aren't many commits.  AND THEN I HAD TO PUSH TO GIT AND OMG.  I had to remove so many repos.  Copy pasted into separate folders so I could remote add.  It's been a crazy struggle and I'm pretty sure I hate GIT.  

Anyway, get it started by rails s and visiting localhost:3000.  That's the index, and it'll take you from there!  You can create a login, make drinks, edit drinks, and delete them if you're so inclined.
